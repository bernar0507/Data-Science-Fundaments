# Clustering Analysis of Thai Fashion Retailers on Facebook

## Overview

This project provides insights into the engagement metrics of 10 Thai fashion and cosmetics retail sellers on Facebook. Through clustering, sellers are grouped based on their post engagement patterns. The K-Means algorithm was chosen for its efficacy in segmenting the data.

## Steps Covered:

1. **Data Preparation:** The dataset was imported, and preliminary cleaning was performed.
2. **Exploratory Analysis:** Assessed data distributions such as post type, hour, and day of the month.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Correlated features were identified and removed to enhance model performance.
4. **Modeling:** Multiple clustering algorithms were tested, including K-Means, Agglomerative Clustering, and others.
5. **Evaluation:** The K-Means algorithm was chosen for deeper analysis. Cluster distributions were evaluated, especially post-undersampling, and profiles were formed based on engagement attributes.
6. **Conclusion:** Insights were derived from the analysis, leading to actionable recommendations.

## Major Conclusions:

- **Popularity Distinction:** Sellers were largely grouped into 'Less Popular' (Cluster 0) and 'Super Popular' (Cluster 1) categories.
- **Post Engagement:** Cluster 1 sellers, irrespective of the nature of the post, always have more likes than Cluster 0.
- **Posting Time Insights:** The window between 5:00 - 10:00 is ideal for maximum engagement. Conversely, the 15:00 - 20:00 window sees diminished interaction.
- **Monthly Engagement Trends:** No single month saw a marked spike in likes. However, Cluster 1 sellers maintained a consistent lead over Cluster 0.
- **Post Interactions:** Specific post interactions, like wows and hahas, don't necessarily correlate with overall post likes.

**Recommendations:** To optimize engagement, sellers are advised to post during early morning hours and take cues from the strategies employed by the more popular Cluster 1 sellers.

## Targeted Marketing Strategies for Each Cluster

### **Cluster 0 (Less Popular Sellers):**

1. **Engage More:** 
   - Initiate **User-Generated Content (UGC)** campaigns. Encourage followers to share their experiences with your products. This not only increases engagement but can also serve as testimonials.
   
2. **Collaborate with Influencers:** 
   - Partner with micro-influencers who resonate with your brand. Their endorsement can provide a significant boost in popularity and trust.

3. **Post Optimization:** 
   - Focus on posting during the peak hours identified (5:00 - 10:00) to gain maximum visibility and engagement.
   
4. **Interactive Content:** 
   - Use polls, quizzes, or Q&A sessions to engage with the audience. This also provides insights into their preferences.

5. **Enhance Post Quality:** 
   - Use high-quality images, engaging captions, and trending hashtags. Also, consider using videos, as they generally have higher engagement rates.

6. **Promotions & Giveaways:** 
   - Organize contests and giveaways with simple participation criteria, like tagging friends or sharing the post. This can rapidly increase reach.

7. **Feedback Loop:** 
   - Actively seek feedback on how to improve. This not only provides insights but also makes the audience feel valued.

### **Cluster 1 (Super Popular Sellers):**

1. **Loyalty Programs:** 
   - With a strong base, introduce loyalty programs to reward frequent shoppers or active followers.

2. **Exclusive Launches:** 
   - Use the platform to introduce new products or limited-edition items. Give your followers the 'first access' feel.

3. **Behind the Scenes:** 
   - Showcase the making of products, team introductions, or fun office moments. This humanizes the brand and strengthens the connection with followers.

4. **Engage Consistently:** 
   - Engage regularly with followers through comments, liking their posts, or even reposting user-generated content.

5. **Collaborate with Brands:** 
   - Collaborations or partnerships with complementary brands can expose your products to a wider audience.

6. **Advanced Analytics:** 
   - Use advanced tools to delve deeper into analytics. Understand what type of content is most engaging and at what times.
7. **Host Live Events:** 
   - Use Facebook Live for product launches, Q&A sessions, or simple interactive sessions. It boosts real-time engagement.
